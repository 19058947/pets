    <H1>Pets</H1>
    <p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.

        Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats, Goldfish and Rabbits. </p>

        <h2>Dogs</h2>
        <p>The companionship between humans and dogs is not a new phenomenon. However, in modern society most dogs are owned as pets, not because of the work they were bred to do. Many breeds, such as the toy dogs, were developed precisely to be pets. All of the diverse breeds and mixed breeds have unique traits and appeal to different kinds of people.
