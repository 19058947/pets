        Goldfish are still a great beginner’s pet, as long as the responsibility is taken seriously. Though you may acquire your goldfish for cheap or even for free, you should still be prepared to invest a bit of time and money into their care.

Fortunately, the biggest costs are upfront, meaning if you get fish tank setup right the first time, you’ll only have to spend a few bucks per month to keep your goldfish happy.
An aquatic breeder may sell exotic, hard-to-find varieties. Since raising and breeding fish is more than a hobby to them, they’ll be able to give you ongoing guidance for keeping your fish healthy.
